Hi, I am Daniella (Zihuiwen) Ye. Welcome to my homepage! I am currently a DPhil student in Computer Science at University of Oxford, supervised by Yarin Gal and Phil Blunsom. 


My research interests lie in enhancing the reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs) for real-world applications, with a particular focus on text generation. Some of the topics I have researched in previous years include improving human preference learning for LLMs, augmenting text-to-code generation processes, and applying diffusion models for text planning.
